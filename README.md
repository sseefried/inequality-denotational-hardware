# Deriving inequality circuits from high-level specification

This is an attempt to derive efficient hardware circuits from a
high-level specification using the discipline of _denotational
design_.

It follows Conal Elliott's [Adders and
Arrows](https://github.com/conal/adders-and-arrows) work very closely.
