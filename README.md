# Deriving inequality circuits from high-level specification

This is an attempt to derive efficient hardware circuits from a
high-level specification using the discipline of [denotational
design](http://conal.net/papers/type-class-morphisms/).



It follows Conal Elliott's [Adders and
Arrows](https://github.com/conal/adders-and-arrows) work very closely.
